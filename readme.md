### Elmish React with Paket base

tested with:

* dotnet core 2.2.104
* node 11.3
* paket 5.203.0

run:

1. `npm install`
1. `paket install` (or `paket restore`?)
1. `npm start`

:information_source: Note: it seems VSCode Ionide goes a bit crazy during paket installation but seems fine afterwards. Might be some misconfiguration on my part.

Also, I realize this is more or less exactly what's in https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/withpaket. That repo is probably better maintained too.
